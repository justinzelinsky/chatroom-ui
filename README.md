The UI for simple chatroom built with React, Redux, and Socket.IO featuring user authentication.

## Purpose

This is my pet project which allows me to test my knowledge of JavaScript and Web Development. The end goal is to have a full CI/CD pipeline.

## Setup & Running

### Install

`npm install`

### Usage

`npm start`

and navigate to `https://localhost:8082`

**Note**: You will need to have the server running as well. You can check out that codebase [here](https://github.com/justinzelinsky/chatroom-server).
